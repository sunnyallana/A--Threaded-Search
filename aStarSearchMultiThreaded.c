/* 
   A* Search Algorithm (Multi-Threaded Version)
   ----------------------------------------------------------
   This version of the A* search algorithm will utilize multiple
   threads to perform pathfinding concurrently.

   Steps:
   1. Implement a thread-safe priority queue (or use synchronization
      primitives like mutexes) to manage access to the open list.
   2. Initialize the start node and insert it into the open list.
   3. Create worker threads to perform the search concurrently:
      a. Each worker thread will repeatedly:
         i. Dequeue a node from the open list (using synchronization).
         ii. If the dequeued node is the goal node, signal completion.
         iii. Otherwise, expand the node similarly to the non-threaded version:
              - Calculate tentative scores for neighbors.
              - Update scores and parent nodes if necessary.
              - Enqueue neighbors into the open list if needed.
   4. Use synchronization mechanisms (e.g., condition variables, mutexes)
      to coordinate access to shared data structures (like the open list).
   5. Wait for all worker threads to finish and collect results.
